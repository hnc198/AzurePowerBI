# Microsoft Cloud Azure PowerBI
*Please provide an introduction to the workshop. For example:*

This workshop has multiple modules to help developers, architects, administrators, and technical sales to learn deep concept in multiple areas of Power BI.

## Target audience
*Please list the target audience for this workshop. For example:*
-	Application developer
-	Infrastructure architect
-	Database administrator
-	AI developer
-	Data scientist

## Abstract
The workshop will discuss the following:
-	Connecting Data Sources
-	Merging Queries
-	Data Modeling
-	Publishing & Sharing Content
-	Embedding

### Workshop
In this workshop, you will look at the process of migrating an on-premises data warehouse to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Throughout the whiteboard design session and hands-on lab, you will look at the planning process for data warehouse migration, identifying schema and data incompatibilities, efficiently migrating data from on-premises databases to the cloud, data distribution in Azure SQL Data Warehouse, migrating ETL jobs to Azure Data Factory, and supporting ad-hoc workloads in an Azure SQL Data Warehouse through Azure Analysis Services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to [deliver, demonstrate, solve, present, migrate, build, design, architect, construct, modify] ….

### Whiteboard design session *(this will go in the readme and in the WDS document)*
In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to look at the process of migrating an on-premises data warehouse to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. The design session will cover planning for a data warehouse migration, data and schema preparation, data loading, optimizing the data distribution, and building a solution to support ad-hoc queries.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to [deliver, demonstrate, solve, present, migrate, build, design, architect, construct, modify] ….

### Hands-on lab *(this will go in the readme and in the HOL document)*
In this hands-on lab, you will migrate an existing on-premises enterprise data warehouse to the cloud. You will investigate the current data warehouse to identify any incompatibilities, you will export the data from the on-premises data warehouse and transfer it to Azure Blob Storage. Then you will load the data into the warehouse. Finally, you will integrate the warehouse by migrating ETL to Azure Data Factory and supporting ad-hoc access by implementing Azure Analysis Services.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to [deliver, demonstrate, solve, present, migrate, build, design, architect, construct, modify] ….
